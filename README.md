# 🛠 Smart Personal Management System (Python Console App)

A modular **console-based personal management system** built with Python — my first end-to-end project.  
It helps you manage diary notes, contacts, expenses, to-dos and includes some handy utilities.

## Features
- 🔐 User authentication (SHA-256 hashed passwords)
- 📝 Diary: add, view, clear timestamped notes
- 📇 Contact Book: add, view, update, delete contacts (stored in `contacts.json`)
- 💰 Expense Tracker: add expenses, view expenses, generate date reports, total expenses
- ✅ To-Do List: add tasks, mark done, view, clear tasks
- 🛠 Utility Tools: calculator, unit converter, random password generator
